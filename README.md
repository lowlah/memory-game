# Memory-game
This is my repository for Udacity's  memory game project using udacity's starter code.
Live version can be found here https://lowlah.github.io/memory-game/

## Game Specifications
The deck consists of 8 unique pairs of cards(16 in total). Cards are arranged randomly using the shuffle function provided.The goal is for a user to click on a card and check if it matches(both cards have the same symbol). Once the user clicks on a card, a timer begins and ends when all cards have been matched. Some css animations were added to highlight correct and incorrect matches. The score board also shows number of moves. Moves here refers to number of correct/incorrect guesses made in order to match a card. Score board also shows star rating, which decreases based on number of moves made.

At the end of the game, a modal box appears congratulating the user and showing no of moves made,time it took to complete the game and star rating. A replay button resets the game and allows a user to play again. Restart button is also included on the score board which also resets the game.
